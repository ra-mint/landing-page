# Landing Page

This is a generic landing page for a friend's mushroom farm business. Originally, I started this as a project for the Odin Project. Though I like the color palette and design TOP suggested, I wanted to turn this into a personal project to test my abilities and make it more relatable.

## Features

To design this website, I was tasked to use CSS Flexbox to arrange my elements. The page should be outlined with:

- A header and footer
- A navbar inside of the header
- Hero text with an image beside it
- Information/Images with subtext
- A quote block
- Sign up/order now bar
